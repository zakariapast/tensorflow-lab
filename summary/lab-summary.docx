🧪 Lab Summary – Part 1: Baseline Model Without Privacy
Objective: Train a simple image classification model using TensorFlow to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This serves as the baseline before adding privacy protections.

🟩 Environment Preparation
Step	Detail
Platform	Google Colab (recommended for GPU + easy setup)
Tools Installed	tensorflow, tensorflow-privacy
Fix Applied	Upgraded packaging to fix dependency error

📦 Dataset Used
Dataset	Description
MNIST	70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28×28 pixels)
Training Set	60,000 images
Test Set	10,000 images
Labels	Integers 0 to 9

🧱 Model Architecture (Baseline)
Layer	Description
Flatten	Converts 28×28 image to 784 vector
Dense(128, relu)	Hidden layer with 128 units
Dense(10)	Output layer for 10 digit classes (0–9)

⚙️ Training Configuration
Parameter	Value
Optimizer	adam
Loss	SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True)
Epochs	5
Validation Split	10% of training data

📈 Training Results
Epoch	Accuracy	Val Accuracy	Loss	Val Loss
1	86.5%	96.4%	0.47	0.12
5	98.6%	97.8%	0.04	0.07

✅ Model performs very well, but privacy risk exists: It could overfit or leak data through future attacks.
